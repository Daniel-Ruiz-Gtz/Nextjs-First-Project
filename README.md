# Next.js Learning Project with Bootstrap: User Display Web App

Welcome to the **Next.js Learning Project**! This project is designed to help you learn and practice building web applications using Next.js, React.js, and Node.js, with an added touch of Bootstrap for styling. In this project, you'll create a simple web app that fetches user data from the [reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) API and displays it in a visually appealing manner.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to give you hands-on experience with the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: A React framework that provides server-side rendering and other advanced features out of the box. You'll learn how to create pages, manage routing, and work with data fetching.

- **Node.js**: A runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. You'll use Node.js to set up a basic server to handle API requests.

- **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework that makes it easy to create responsive and visually appealing designs. You'll use Bootstrap classes to style your components and make your app look polished.

- **reqres.in API**: You'll interact with the [reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) API to fetch user data. This will give you practical experience in making API requests and handling the data you receive.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the App**: In your terminal, run the following command to start the app:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Explore and Learn**: The app will open in your browser. You'll see a simple interface that fetches and displays user data from the [reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) API. Use the app, explore the code, and modify it to learn about Next.js pages, routing, data fetching, and Bootstrap styling.

## Learning Goals

By completing this project, you will gain valuable experience in the following areas:

- Creating pages and managing routing with Next.js.
- Fetching and displaying data from the [reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) API using Next.js.
- Applying Bootstrap styles to your Next.js components.
- Gaining familiarity with frontend-backend interactions in a Next.js environment.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this project as you learn more about Next.js, React.js, Node.js, and web development. Good luck and happy coding!
